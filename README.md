# Recipe Api Intro to PostgreSQL

_16th October 2020_
_Week 4 at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk)_

This was our week 4 Friday hackathon at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk) which was our first full-stack application using node.js, express, postgreSQL and JavaScript

Dan Watson @danwatson2309 (my paired-programming partner for the week) and I created a front-end to display our energiser game scores and a back-end with persistent storage

This was a really fun hackethon and we were super proud of it
